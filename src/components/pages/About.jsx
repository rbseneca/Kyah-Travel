              <p>
                People often inquire about the significance of KYAH. It appears that this is a relatively new term to many. KYAH is a Filipino expression of endearment used for an older brother, referred to as "KUYA". This travel agency was named after the owner's love of travel, meeting lots of people in the street who appreciate the sunshine and the ocean, thus the name of the travel agency.
